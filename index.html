          Hi there my name is Michael Tulmen, thanks for accessing my personal
          portfolio website. I am an Accounting B.S. graduate with a background
          in foreign language actively pursuing opportunities to gain experience
          in professional accounting practices and software development roles.
          My main goal is to expand my knowledge through diligent work and
          deliberation with other professionals. My interest in technology and
          foreign language pushes me to identify and analyze trends across the
          financial spectrum and on a global scale to help develop a more
          advanced future.

            <p>
              This project was our first completely full stack application where
              we chose to go about creating something we were all interested
              in... games. The idea behind this project was that to play the
              tabletop game Slayers, you would obviously need to create and
              manage your characters, parties, and statistics from one Platform.
